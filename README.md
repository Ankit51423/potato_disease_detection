# potato_disease_detection

Let's start by reading the content of the file.

Based on the content of your Python file, it appears to be a machine learning project that uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of potato leaves, likely to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves. The code includes steps to:

1. Mount Google Drive.
2. Load and preprocess image datasets.
3. Define and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
4. Evaluate the model.
5. Visualize predictions.
6. Save the model's performance metrics and predictions in JSON format.

## Project Overview

This project classifies potato leaves into healthy and diseased categories using a deep learning model. The model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images and evaluated for accuracy and loss. The results, including accuracy and loss history, evaluation metrics, and predictions, are saved in JSON format.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/potato-leaf-disease-classification.git
    cd potato-leaf-disease-classification
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Mount Google Drive (if using Google Colab):

    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

2. Update the `path` variable to point to your dataset in Google Drive:

    ```python
    path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/color'
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python potatoleafdisease.py
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized into subdirectories for each class (e.g., `Potato___Early_blight`, `Potato___Late_blight`, `Potato___healthy`). Update the `path` variable in the script to point to the dataset location.

## Model Architecture

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following layers:

- Convolutional layers
- Max pooling layers
- Flatten layer
- Dense (fully connected) layers
- Dropout layers for regularization

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation. The training and validation datasets are split using `train_test_split`. The model is evaluated on the test dataset, and the results are saved in JSON format.

## Results

The training history, evaluation metrics, and image predictions are saved in JSON format. The JSON output includes:

- Accuracy and loss history
- Training and test evaluation metrics
- Model summary
- Image predictions with actual and predicted labels
